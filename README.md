A cool game!


**This is a design doc**


This game has *users* who have *guilds* which hire *adventurers* who go on *quests* which are won by the *users* through a *bid*ding process. *Adventurers* are also hired through a *bid*ing process. 


*Adventurers* are created by going to a *town square*. These *adventurers* can be hired outright, so *users* do not need to bid on them. Experienced *adventurers*, though, will appear on the *free market* if they are not associeted with a *guild*. These *adventurers* will work for the *guild* that offers the highest bid for their services. *Adventurers* require certain ammenities such as *training rooms* at the *guildhall*, and monthly salaries. If a *guild* cannot provide for the *adventurer*'s needs, the *adventurer* may become dissatisfied and leave the guild to work on the *free market*.


*Gold* is the primary currency in the game. It is generated by sending adventurers on *quests*. There are two types of *quests*. Generic ones that *users* can send their *adventurers* on at any time for returns of small sums of *gold*, and open bid *quests* that must be won through a bidding process, but potentialy have higher payouts and other rewards, such as special *equipment* and *titles* for *adventurers*.


*Quests* are procedurally generated, and are executed by adventurers automatically. When an *adveturer* embarks on a *quest*, they will have a calculated probability of success based on a number of factors including the difficulty and challenges involved in the *quest* and the *adventurer*'s experience level and *skills*. Some *quests* may require specific *skills* for the *adventurer* to be successful. *Succeeding* in a quest earns the *guild* money, and experience, fame, and *equipment* for the adventurer. 


*Guilds* have *guild halls* that begin as single room dormatories, but can be improved by purchasing new *rooms*. These *rooms* allow *adventurers* to spend time training and gaining experience outside of *adventures*.
